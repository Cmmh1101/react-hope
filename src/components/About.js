          <h4>Hope For The Nations Mission</h4>
          <p>
            Hope for the Nations is a non-profit, Christian organization. We
            count on a ministry of ambassadors that serves children, older
            people, and families in Venezuelaâ€™s most impoverished area. As we
            help them, we bring the gospel nurturing not only with physical
            needs but we spiritual needs as well.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            All these projects aim to help people be sustainable because we do
            not want to treat the problem; we are looking for long-term
            solutions.
